# Blueprint for a Texas Hold'em 1v1 bot
# The bot will face of against the user
# The bot will be able to play a game of Texas Hold'em and determine the winner

# What will be needed:
# A function that runs the game
# A bot that acts as a player
# The bot will make "decisions" depending on the hand and board
# classes
# card(defines a card), deck(keeps track of the deck), board(keeps track of the cards on the board and the pot),
# hand(the player (and bot?). keeps track of the hand and possible actions)

# Plan
# Create the different classes of the game
# Make the game playable by two people
# Then make the bot
